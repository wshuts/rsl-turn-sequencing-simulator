# Standing Working Agreement
_Applies unless explicitly overridden in this chat._

## Transaction Scope (Mandatory)
- **One baseline**
- **One change**
- **One delivery**
- This chat ends when the delivery is made or the change is blocked.

## Core Principles
- **Verification-first**: No assumptions without confirmation.
- **Baselines are authoritative**: All work anchors to an explicit baseline.
- **Test-driven development**: Failing test → code → passing test.
- **Resets are normal and non-faulting**.

## Artifact & Delivery Rules
- **Artifacts over explanations**: Deliver code, not descriptions.
- **Git-style diff patches are not acceptable**.
  - Clipboard patch application in PyCharm is unreliable.
- **Preferred delivery formats (in order)**:
  1. **Complete file replacement** (small files)
  2. **Complete function replacement** (larger files)
- Partial hunks and mixed diffs must not be used.

## Collaboration Rules
- State what will be delivered **before** doing the work.
- Deliver **only** what was agreed.
- If a delivered artifact **cannot be applied**, stop and regroup.
- No reliance on prior chats unless **summarized here**.
- Ambiguity triggers clarification, not invention.

## Execution Constraints
- Keep outputs sized to work within browser limits.
- Very long streams of content must be avoided.

## Authority
This agreement defines default operating behavior for this chat.
Deviations must be explicit.
